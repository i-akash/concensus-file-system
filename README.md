### Consensus File System

A Consensus file system comprises miners and clients (end-user).

*Features:*
  - Clients submit the operations on file to their connected miners using CFS lib.
  - Miners broadcast operations that are submitted by the clients to the rest of the miner network.
  - Miners also help other miners with their operation dissemination.
  - Miners generate blocks for the blockchain by solving the proof of work and some number of coins is credited on confirmation of the block.
  - Miner disseminates valid blocks which are mined locally or by the other miners.
