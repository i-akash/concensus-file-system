# Consensus File System (CFS)

The **Consensus File System (CFS)** is a decentralized file system that leverages blockchain technology. It ensures secure, consistent, and fault-tolerant file operations across a distributed network. CFS is composed of **miners** and **clients**, working together to maintain consensus and integrity of the file system.

---

## Features

- **Client Operations Submission**:  
  Clients submit file operations through the **CFS library**, which abstracts the complexities of interacting with the miner network.

- **Miner Operation Broadcasting**:  
  Miners broadcast received operations to the entire miner network, ensuring consistent dissemination.

- **Inter-Miner Collaboration**:  
  Miners help each other propagate operations, improving fault tolerance and resilience.

- **Block Generation and Proof of Work (PoW)**:  
  Miners solve computational challenges (PoW) to generate blocks. On block confirmation, miners are rewarded with coins.

- **Block Dissemination**:  
  Miners share valid blocks, whether mined locally or received from other miners, ensuring ledger consistency across the network.

## Architecture Overview

+-------------------+       +-------------------+  
|      Client       | <---> |       Miner        |  
+-------------------+       +-------------------+  
                                  |  
                                  v  
                      +-----------------------+  
                      |     Miner Network      |  
                      +-----------------------+  


```

## How It Works

### Clients Submit Operations
Clients use the **CFS library** to submit file operations to their connected miners.

### Broadcasting Operations
Miners broadcast the received operations to the entire network for consensus.

### Mining and Rewards
Miners solve **Proof of Work (PoW)** challenges, validate operations, and generate new blocks. Successful miners are rewarded with coins.

### Propagating Blocks
Valid blocks are propagated across the network to maintain a consistent blockchain ledger.
